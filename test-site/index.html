      <i> "The water is still and silent; if it weren’t for the gentle waves brushing the bank,
      I’d never even know it was flowing. When I look up, I see more sky than I’ve ever seen before,
      because the river is so wide that the canopy cannot stretch over it. The exposed band of night
      is laced with stars. The river, too, is full of them, ten thousand reflections glittering down
      its dark blue-grey length." </i>
